              Have you completed the first draft of your manuscript and need
              someone else to give you feedback before you dive back in? I got
              you! I will read your manuscript in full and provide feedback on
              the big picture elements of your story. This is for authors with a
              finished manuscript who are looking to address overarching
              elements like plot, structure, characterization, and style. If
              this is for an illustrated project it can also include feedback on
              illustrations, layout, and character design.
